/**
 * CourseHome — the course landing page (Phase D). What `/` renders.
 *
 * Before this, `/` rendered lo-00-example itself: `dist/index.html` and
 * `dist/example.html` were the same page, and a second LO's page was an orphan
 * nothing linked to. This is the index that fixes both — hero copy from
 * `course.config.ts`, a left sliding lesson nav, and one card per LO folder.
 *
 * NOTHING here enumerates LOs, and nothing authors their card text: the `lessons`
 * prop is `buildLoIndex()`'s output, built from the folders under `lo-config/` and
 * each folder's own manifest. Adding a folder adds a card, with no code change.
 *
 * The LO arrives as a PROP for the same reason `App` takes one (Part D): two entries
 * render this tree from two different readers — `main.tsx` in the browser via
 * `load-lo-glob`, `scripts/prerender.tsx` under Bun via `load-lo-disk` — so the
 * choice of reader belongs to the entry and this component stays pure.
 *
 * DOM mirrors the shell's contract (docs/specs/lo-semantic-structure.md §1): skip
 * link first, one <header>, one <main id="content" tabindex="-1">, one <h1>, and a
 * strict h1 → h2 → h3 outline (hero → "Lessons" → card titles). The one nav landmark
 * on this page is the lesson nav; there are no in-page sections to link to.
 *
 * THERE IS NO TOP BAR, AND <header> IS NOW AN EMPTY-LOOKING WRAPPER ON PURPOSE
 * (§D · D7). The landing page's chrome is the left rail; a bar above it was a second
 * piece of furniture holding one title and one toggle, and both found better homes —
 * the title in the hero below, the toggle in the rail.
 *
 * The <header> element STAYS because §17 puts the page's primary nav inside it and
 * guard h enforces that (it caught an earlier shape with `nav-outside-header`). It
 * carries no styling and every child it has is `position: fixed`, so it collapses to
 * zero height and paints nothing of its own — which is also why it must NOT be given a
 * background, a border or a `backdrop-filter`: a `backdrop-filter` in particular would
 * make it the containing block for those fixed descendants and pin the rail and the
 * panel inside a zero-height box.
 *
 * THE COURSE TITLE IS AN <hgroup> SUBTITLE, NOT A HEADING. `courseTitle` and the hero
 * subheading are both styled prominently and neither is a section heading — the outline
 * is h1 (hero) → h2 ("Lessons") → h3 (card titles), and inserting either would break it.
 * `<hgroup>` is the element the HTML Living Standard defines for exactly this: one
 * h1–h6 plus any number of <p> that qualify it. That makes the relationship explicit
 * instead of leaving two floating styled paragraphs for a checker to guess at.
